# Mobile-Planer
Mobile planer application created for research needs in the thesis task. The goal to be achieved is to create a personal financial design system for users who have monthly income using the Fuzzy Tsukamoto method.
The benefits of designing this system are:
1. Create a medium for users to be able to manage their monthly income based on their priority needs.
2. Provide appropriate design of income allocation for each priority need.

Personal Financial Planning is an act of design that is used to manage all financial activities within a certain period of time. Inside there are various considerations regarding how to maximize the use of income owned to meet needs.
In order for this plan to be fulfilled, research is needed using the following methods:

1. Fuzzy Tsukamoto method is used to help carry out the right planning optimally, and is expected to facilitate the granting of a more precise, easy, and effective assessment in the financial system design process.

2. Compound Interest, Interest is the excess money that a person returns when he borrows money. Interest on money is always expressed in percent (%). In the calculation of interest there are two kinds of ways, namely single interest and compound interest. This research will use compound interest to calculate the predicted price of an item in the future. <br>

Where: <br>
Mn = Capital of the nth year <br>
Mo = Initial capital <br>
i = Percent of interest (in decimal) <br>
n = nth period (usually in years) <br>

3. Annuity
There are two types of annuities, ordinary annuities, namely cash flow that occurs at the end of the period and anuity due, namely cash flow that occurs at the beginning of the period. In this case using anuity due which can be stated in the formula PMT (payment): <br>

Where: <br>
Rate = Interest Rate <br>
Fv = Savings that you want to achieve <br>
Pv = Existing savings <br>
Nper = Many Annuities / Duration <br>
